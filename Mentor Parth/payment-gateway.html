                        PayPal is a global payment platform available in 200+ countries across the world. PayPal claims
                        to have processed 4 billion payments (including 1 billion mobile) in 2014. Over 173 million
                        customers use Paypal on a regular basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>That is the reason if you are expecting orders from international consumers, you have to have
                        PayPal integrated into your eCommerce Store. PayPal supports more than 100 currencies with a
                        fund withdrawal facility in your bank accounts in 57 currencies and holds balances in their
                        PayPal accounts in 26 currencies.</p>
                    <p>
                        In India, merchants primarily use PayPal to receive funds from foreign customers only as due to
                        banking regulations an Indian company cannot accept Indian credit cards via Paypal.

                        <li>
                            International Payment / Credit card Support: PayPal can be used by an Indian merchant only
                            for receiving international payments only. PayPal does not support or recognize Indian
                            currency, therefore you need to choose an international currency as the base currency. What
                            it means is that if somebody pays you in say Australian dollar through PayPal on your
                            eCommerce store, PayPal will first convert that to US$ (with currency conversion charges).
                            Therefore when you withdraw money from PayPal you will again pay currency conversion charges
                            for conversion to Indian Rupee at your bank in India.

                            Withdrawal Fees: There are no withdrawal fees on PayPal. However, as you will be receiving
                            money on a regular basis from PayPal (Through their Banker-CitiBank) you need to obtain
                            proof of foreign inward remittances in the form of a certificate called “Foreign Inward
                            Remittance Certificate or FIRC”. FIRC is a document that acts as a testimonial for all the
                            inward remittances entering India. Most of the statutory authorities accept this document as
                            proof that an individual or a business, such as a limited company, partnership firm, sole
                            proprietorship firm, and others, has received payment in foreign currency from outside the
                            country.

                        <li> Documentation required: The documentation process is quite simple. It only takes a few
                            minutes to start a PayPal merchant account. To do so you need to confirm your identity. To
                            do so verify your PAN, add a local bank account, and a purpose code (The Purpose Codes have
                            been introduced to identify the nature of the cross-border transaction payment made in
                            compliance with regulatory requirements. Businesses are required to furnish the appropriate
                            purpose codes from pre-filled dropdowns when they initiate a withdrawal from their PayPal
                            account to their Indian bank accounts) and confirm your email address. It is the easiest of
                            the lot.</li>

                        If you want to add a payment gateway to your website, connect with your developer. The method
                        depends on the website technology stack. If your website is built with a popular CMS you can use
                        a pre-existing plugin to add it to your website. Otherwise, you need to use APIs to add it to
                        your website.
